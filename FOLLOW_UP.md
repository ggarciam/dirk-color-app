### Q) What libraries did you add and why? What are they used for?
I didn't add any libraries to make the process easier and faster, even though I think a couple libraries would improve the development phase: 
* **SASS**: Including CSS preprocessing would make the development easier and reduce the amount of possible mistakes.
* **Bootstrap**: The project is really small and maybe not that necessary, but even to position components Bootstrap can be a good choice (easy to make future possible changes in the component organization in space).
### Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?
About 6 hours. In this case a more seasoned React developer would have finished it for sure in less time, but I wanted to make sure to follow the best practices in order to organize the architecture of the project.

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
I would have added testing for the different components, functions, etc. It is possibly out of the scope for this assignment, but the structure of the project is already prepared to include testing functionalities.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
The modularisation of the different parts of the project. It is possible to reuse the different components (color, title), independent on the parent component where it is used.
I also included BEM notation, even when it was not necessary, but this would also make easier to understand the structure of the different elements.

### Q) What did you find most difficult?
As usual the most difficult part can be the communication between the different components (parent-child), but being such a straightforward project, it wasn't much of a hassle.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
I think the test is simple, but enough to show some analysis capabilities and code styling of a candidate. The rest can be always found in an interview ;)
